# Flushr
<a href="https://shielded-meadow-90570.herokuapp.com/#/?_k=vbkalb" target="_onclick">Flushr</a> is a web application for users to find, review, and rate public restrooms anywhere in the world. Built with Ruby, Rails, Flux, React.js, PostgreSQL, Google Maps API, Twitter Bootstrap, and jQuery.
<p>
This platform also relies on crowdsourcing so new restroom location information is kept up-to-date. With a Flushr account, a user can instantly place a new marker on Google Maps whenever a new restroom is encountered as well as write reviews for restrooms. However, anyone can access Flushr's search feature and read user reviews at a particular location.
